Simple usb grabber (copies all data of the first external drive it founds to your usb stick). Please be responsible, when using this software (see license). 

## How to get started
1. Copy the content of the "Auf USB"-folder onto YOUR usb stick/drive. 
1. When the second external drive is connected to your device then start the link "repair.smart". (Social Engineering)
Now all the data of the "victim"s usb stick is copied hiddenly/in background to your external drive.

## No Warranty
As I made many years ago at school age, I just wanted to learn the language. This software was never used (without explicitely permission of all participants) outside of my own private network at home. So, I don't take any warranty in using this software and want to encourage you to use this software **only** for education purposes. Please be responsible and don't do sth. you will regret later.
