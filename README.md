Simple usb grabber (copies all data of the first external drive it founds to your usb stick). Please be responsible, when using this software (see license). 

## How to get started
1. Copy the content of the "Auf USB"-folder onto YOUR usb stick/drive. 
1. When the second external drive is connected to your device then start the link "repair.smart". (Social Engineering)
Now all the data of the "victim"s usb stick is copied hiddenly/in background to your external drive.
